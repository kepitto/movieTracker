Why we choose SQL over NoSQL - 

We chose a PostgreSQL database since it is simple and we know how to use it.  

In general for our application it could make sense to use a NoSQL database when we want to save large amount of realtime  
data and NoSQL databases can handle large volumes of data better. - more performant  
NoSQL would be more flexible since we could add or remove fields without modifying the db schema  

On the other hand if we would need to make complex joins or aggregations on the data SQL would be better again.
